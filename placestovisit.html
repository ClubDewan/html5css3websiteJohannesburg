<h1>Amazing things to do in Johannesburg and Places to visit there</h1>
<p>South Africa is one of the most amazing countries in the world. It is a extensively travelling country so I know what I'm talking about when it come down to writing a list of the top things to do in Johannesburg.</p>
<br>
<p>This list is meant to summarize countless months and years of traveling through the Rainbow nation. It's purpose is to give you a small flavor of what South Africa has to offer and hopefully induces a little bit of FOMO for you to start planning your trip. Whether you're planning a two week trip to South Africa or a South African honeymoon mainly in Johannesburg</p>
<br>

<h2>Climb Lion's Head in Cape Town</h2>
<p> Shortly after hiking Table Mountain, we were aiming to go to Cape Point midday but the traffic was so horrible that we turned around and went back to our hotel in Camps Bay</p>
<br>
<p>To get to Lion’s Head, simply drive on the road towards Signal Hill and the base of Lion’s Head will be located before you reach it. There is parking all on the side of the road and you’ll know where the entrance is just by the row of cars parked.</p>
<br>
<p>The hike up Lion’s Head is much easier physically than Table Mountain. Not only is it a shorter hike but it zig zag’s around the mountain whereas Table Mountain is a straight shot up. Lion's Head is also a more fun hike in my opinion as there are some very minor rock climbing (chains and ladders) aspect to it!</p>
<br>
<p>All in all, the hike will take about 45 minutes to 1 hour. When you’re at the top, you’ll see many other hikers soaking up the views. There are no bars and no restaurants here, it’s completely untamed which I absolutely loved. During the summer months, the top can be quite packed but can you blame people for appreciating such stunning views?</p>
<br>
</li>
<li>
    <h2>Cape Point Day Trip</h2>
    <p>If there's one thing I tell my people not to miss when visiting Cape Town is a day trip to the absolutely stunning Cape Point. Cape Point is home to the famous Cape Point lighthouse as well as the Cape of Good Hope where the Indian and Atlantic oceans meet. It is not the southern most point of South Africa, that honor goes to Cape Aghulas but that is a 3 hour drive from Cape Town.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Cape Point, along with visiting Boulders beach home to the African penguin colony, Muizenberg beach, and the Chapman’s peak drive make for the absolute perfect day trip from Cape Town</p>

<li>
    <h2>Table Mountain</h2>
    <p>No trip to South Africa is complete without a visit to Cape Town and no trip to Cape Town is complete without a visit to the world famous Table Mountain.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One the absolute best things to do in Cape Town and undoubtedly one of its top attractions, Table Mountain was recently voted as one of the new wonders of the world. It’s not hard to see why. Its impossibly flat peak is visible from all of the surrounding area and is perhaps the most iconic landmark in Cape Town. Sandwiched between Devils Peak and Lions Head, Table Mountain stands 1km above sea level. It is also one of one of the oldest mountains in the world being hundreds of millions of years older than even the Himalayas.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Then there are the views. Panoramic views of Cape Town, all the way down to Cape Point can be seen from its peak allowing for breathtaking photos.</p>

    <h2>Apartheid Museum</h2>
    <p>If you're visiting in Johannesburg or just stopping in for a day or two before your safari, a visit to the Apartheid Museum is a must. Like the Jim Crow era of the United States, Apartheid was a dark and grim period of South Africa's past where non-white races were systematically discriminated against according to official Government policy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Life during this time for Blacks and other non-white ethnicities were terrible to say the least. This era lasted for many decades and only officially ended in 1994 with the democratic election of Nelson Mandela. This museum is very well constructed offering a glimpse into the life of the not so distant past and a reminder of how stark the differences are between now and just a few decades ago.</p>
    <br>
    <img id="museum" src="./graphics/apartheidmuseumpool.JPG" alt="Apartheid Museum">
    <p>It's common to combine a visit to the Apartheid museum with a tour of the Soweto township, which is the largest township in South Africa. Townships were the ghettos that blacks were forced to live in during Apartheid. Nowadays, Soweto is quickly gentrifying and has become a vibrant cultural center of the Black South African community.</p>

<h2>Road Trip Through the Garden Route</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, one of the best road trips in the world is in the Garden Route of South Africa. This 1,000km stretch of coastline stretching from Cape Town to Plettenberg Bay is jam packed with incredible beaches, hikes, views, animals, and more.</p>
<img src="./graphics/cloudysky.jpg" alt="cloudy sky on road trip">
<p>Famous destinations like Plettenberg Bay, Knysna, George, Wilderness, Tsitsikama National Park, and more are just a few of the destinations you can plan for when doing this trip. You’ll can rent a car from Cape Town and drive at your own pace towards George or Plettenberg Bay where you can either drop the car off and continue somewhere else or return to Johannesburg.</p>
<br>
<p>I would recommend at least 5 days driving this route as there are so many amazing stops along the way.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h2>world famous safari</h2>
<p>No trip to South Africa is complete without a world famous safari in one of the many national parks of South Africa.</p>
<br>
<p>The Kruger National Park is the flagship of the South African parks, and in my opinion, probably the easiest accessed, most budget friendly safari option with the widest variety of wildlife you will find anywhere in Africa.</p>
<br>
<p>The park itself contains hundreds of thousands of creatures, made up of over seven hundred species of birds, mammals and reptiles, as well as containing archaeological, historic and cultural treasures. I visited the Kruger many times, and it makes for an easy trip for those visiting from out of the country, or those living in Johannesburg.</p>
<br>
<p>Located in a summer rainfall area, the park can be very hot and humid at this time, and daytime temperatures from October to March can range from mid twenties up to into the forties, nights in winter can drop to single figures but daytime temperatures are mostly perfect, sunny and low to mid twenties.</p>
<br>
<img src="./graphics/rhinos.webp" alt="Rhinos in the wildlife Park">
<p>This makes the park suitable to visit all year round, with varying temperatures throughout due its vast size and number of eco systems. I've been to many game parks all around Africa and I always recommend the Kruger for the beginners as it has something for everyone. However, I still think the most picturesque and “elite” safaris are in East Africa, particularly in the Serengeti and Masai Mara.</p>
<br>

    <h2>Drakensberg Hiking</h2>
    <p>Hiking the Drakensberg Valley of South Africa is a truly unforgettable experience. The Drakensberg Mountains, also known as the Dragon Mountains, are located in the eastern part of the country and stretch for over 1,000 kilometers. The valley is situated in the heart of the mountain range and is a popular destination for hikers and nature enthusiasts.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Drakensberg Valley offers some of the most breathtaking scenery in all of South Africa. The rugged peaks, deep gorges, and rolling hills are a sight to behold. The valley is also home to a wide range of flora and fauna, including rare species such as the Bearded Vulture, which can be seen soaring overhead.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One of the most popular hiking trails in the Drakensberg Valley is the Amphitheatre trail. This trail takes hikers on a 4-5 hour journey through some of the most stunning scenery in the region. The trail leads to the top of the Amphitheatre, a natural amphitheater-like formation that offers panoramic views of the surrounding mountains and valleys.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another popular hiking trail in the Drakensberg Valley is the Tugela Gorge trail. This trail takes hikers on a 5-6 hour journey through a deep gorge, past cascading waterfalls, and through dense forests. The trail leads to the Tugela Falls, the second-highest waterfall in the world, which drops 948 meters from the top of the Drakensberg Mountains.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Drakensberg Valley is also home to a number of unique rock art sites. The San people, who lived in the region thousands of years ago, left behind a rich legacy of rock art. These sites are well-preserved and offer a fascinating glimpse into the lives of these ancient people.</p>

    <h2>Blyde River Canyon</h2>
    <p>Blyde River Canyon in Mpumalanga offers some superb climbing on quartzite mesas, and Waterval Boven has over 700 routes on orange quartzite. This is South Africa’s premier sport climbing destination, with routes for every level and taste.</p>

    <h2>Cave exploring in Oudtshoorn</h2>
    <p>The Cango Caves are well known throughout South Africa and is a hugely popular destination for the locals and foreign tourists alike. We came here the morning after the Ostrich riding and it was packed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>here are two tours you can here, “The standard tour” , and “Adventure Tour”. Naturally, being the adventurous type that we are, we straight away book the Adventure tour. It lasts about 1.5-2 hours depending on how many people are on the trip and because it was peak season, this place was packed.</p>

    <h2>Whale Watching</h2>
